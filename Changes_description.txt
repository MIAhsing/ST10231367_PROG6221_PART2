The code now uses a List<List<object>> named mainList instead of the ArrayList. This change provides type safety and makes the code more modern and readable.

A delegate variable recipeNotificationDelegate has been added to allow notifications when a recipe exceeds a certain calorie limit. 
This delegate can be used to notify the user or perform any other desired action.

The AddRecipe() method has been updated to include additional information for each ingredient, such as quantity, unit of measurement, calories, and food group. 
It validates user input for the number of recipes, number of ingredients, and food group options to ensure valid data entry.

The PrintRecipes() method now provides two options: printing recipes in the order they were added or printing recipes in alphabetical order by recipe name. 
The recipes are displayed with detailed ingredient information, step details, and total calorie count. 
If a recipe exceeds 300 calories, it triggers the NotifyRecipeExceedsCalories() method using the delegate to notify the user.

These changes enhance the code's readability, maintainability, and user experience. 
It provides better validation and more detailed information for each recipe, allowing users to add, scale, print, and remove recipes conveniently. 
The introduction of delegates allows for extensibility by enabling notifications or custom actions when a recipe exceeds a specific calorie limit.
